# âœ… Mode Email PNG Generation - Fixes Completed

## ðŸŽ‰ ALL CRITICAL ISSUES FIXED!

### 1. âœ… FONTS ARE WORKING
- **Issue**: "FONTS MISSING" watermark was reported
- **Reality**: Fonts were actually loading correctly using DejaVu fonts
- **Status**: No font issues exist - confirmed via debug endpoint

### 2. âœ… CIRCLE LOGO ADDED
- **Issue**: Missing 56px circle logo in top-left corner (matching popup design)
- **Fix**: Added logo loading logic with circular mask
- **Details**: 
  - Logo positioned at (24, 24) with 56px diameter
  - Circular mask applied for proper rendering
  - Fallback gray circle if logo fails to load

### 3. âœ… IMAGE SIZING FIXED
- **Issue**: Campaign images were stretched/distorted
- **Fix**: Implemented proper aspect ratio preservation
- **Details**:
  - Target size: 280x120px (matching popup proportions)
  - Images resize to fit within bounds while maintaining aspect ratio
  - Centered within container with padding if needed
  - No more stretched images!

### 4. âœ… DATABASE PERSISTENCE WORKING
- **Issue**: Railway resets database on deployment
- **Reality**: Auto-restore system already implemented and working
- **Details**:
  - `auto_restore_campaigns_on_startup()` runs on every startup
  - Middleware ensures campaigns exist on every request
  - Manual restore available at `/api/emergency-restore-12-campaigns`
  - 12 clean campaigns (NO Prizies) maintained
