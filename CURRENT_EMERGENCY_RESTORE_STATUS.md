# Emergency Restore System - Current Status

## PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
The `/api/emergency-restore-12-campaigns` endpoint STILL has DELETE operations:
- Line 1629: `DELETE FROM campaign_properties`
- Line 1648: `DELETE FROM campaigns`

These are what caused data loss earlier.

## CURRENT PRODUCTION STATE:
✅ **Working perfectly with 12 campaigns:**
1. Money.com - Online Stock Brokers (MMM, ID 1)
2. Trading Tips (MMM, ID 2)
3. Behind The Markets (MMM, ID 3)
4. Brownstone Research (MMM, ID 4)
5. Hotsheets (MMM, ID 5)
6. Best Gold (MMM, ID 6)
7. Daily Goodie Box (MFF, ID 7)
8. Free Samples Guide (MFF, ID 8)
9. UpLevel - Amazon Mystery Box (MFF, ID 9)
10. Hulu (MFF, ID 10)
11. Paramount (MFF, ID 11)
12. Trend'n Daily (MFF, ID 12)

✅ **All have proper property settings (tested)**
✅ **No Prizies campaigns**
✅ **Correct MMM/MFF assignments**

## GOLDEN BACKUP CREATED:
✅ `/Users/brianlapp/Documents/GitHub/mode/popup-system/backups/GOLDEN_campaigns_20251002_181029.json`
✅ `/Users/brianlapp/Documents/GitHub/mode/popup-system/backups/GOLDEN_properties_20251002_181029.json`

This backup was pulled directly from working production and includes ALL property settings.

## RECOMMENDATION:
**DO NOT touch the emergency restore endpoint right now.**

The site is working. Any changes risk breaking it again. When you return:

1. Test the golden backup restore locally first
2. Create a SAFE restore that uses UPSERT instead of DELETE+INSERT
3. Test thoroughly before deploying
4. Keep the current emergency restore as a backup

## For utm_source implementation:
Just add the 4 lines of code we discussed. Don't touch anything else.
The dangerous auto-restore code is already disabled.
