# üö® URGENT: DATABASE WIPED AGAIN - RAILWAY RESTORE NEEDED

**Date**: October 4, 2025  
**Time**: Evening  
**Status**: üî• PRODUCTION DOWN - Database Empty  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Immediate restoration required

---

## üìã IMMEDIATE SITUATION

### **‚ùå What Happened**
- Railway deployment just completed 
- **Database is WIPED** - all campaigns gone
- **Previous fix failed** - railway.toml consolidation didn't prevent reset
- **Production impact**: Popup system has no campaigns to display

### **‚ö° IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**
1. **RESTORE DATABASE** using emergency endpoint
2. **VERIFY 12 campaigns** are restored and active  
3. **INVESTIGATE** why railway.toml fix didn't work
4. **DETERMINE** if UTM attribution code caused the issue

---

## üõ†Ô∏è EMERGENCY RESTORATION

### **Method 1: Emergency Endpoint**
```
POST https://mode-dash-production.up.railway.app/api/emergency-restore-12-campaigns
```

### **Method 2: Golden Backup Restore**
Use the GOLDEN backup files:
- `popup-system/backups/GOLDEN_campaigns_20251002_181029.json`
- `popup-system/backups/GOLDEN_properties_20251002_181029.json`

### **Expected Result**
- ‚úÖ **12 campaigns restored** (6 MMM Finance + 6 MFF Lifestyle)
- ‚úÖ **No Prizies campaigns** 
- ‚úÖ **Property assignments** correctly configured
- ‚úÖ **Popup system functional** 

---

## üîç INVESTIGATION REQUIRED

### **Possible Root Causes**
1. **Volume Mounting Still Failing**: railway.toml fix didn't actually work
2. **UTM Code Issue**: New JavaScript caused deployment problems
3. **Database Path Resolution**: Still resolving to wrong location
4. **Railway Infrastructure**: Platform-level issue with volume persistence

### **Recent Changes Made**
- ‚úÖ Removed duplicate `/popup-system/railway.toml` 
- ‚úÖ Added UTM attribution to `popup.js` (JavaScript changes)
- ‚úÖ Created test files and validation scripts
- ‚ùå Database still wiped despite fixes

---

## üìä CURRENT STATE

### **Railway Configuration**
- **Active Config**: `/workspace/railway.toml` (unified configuration)
- **Volume Mount**: `/app/popup-system/api/data` 
- **Start Command**: `cd popup-system/api && uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT --workers 2`

### **What Should Be Working**
- Database should persist at `/app/popup-system/api/data/popup_campaigns.db`
- Volume `popup-database` should be mounted correctly
- No more database resets on deployment

### **What's Actually Happening**  
- Database still gets wiped on deployment
- Volume mounting may not be working correctly
- Need deeper investigation into Railway deployment process

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS FOR RAILWAY AGENT

### **Step 1: IMMEDIATE (5 minutes)**
1. **Restore database** using emergency endpoint
2. **Verify 12 campaigns** are active and displaying
3. **Check popup functionality** on MFF and MMM properties

### **Step 2: INVESTIGATE (15 minutes)**
1. **Check Railway logs** for volume mounting messages
2. **Verify volume configuration** in Railway dashboard
3. **Test database path** - SSH into container and check `/app/popup-system/api/data/`
4. **Determine if UTM changes** caused any deployment issues

### **Step 3: ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS (30 minutes)**
1. **Compare successful vs failed deployments** 
2. **Check if volume actually persists** between deployments
3. **Investigate Railway infrastructure** issues
4. **Document real root cause** and permanent solution

## üìã BACKUP FILES AVAILABLE

### **Safety Backups Created Today**
- **Complete backup**: `/workspace/SAFETY_BACKUP_20251004_204719/`
- **Railway configs**: Both original railway.toml files preserved
- **Golden data**: GOLDEN campaigns and properties backups available

### **Emergency Restoration Data**
- **Endpoint**: `/api/emergency-restore-12-campaigns`
- **Backup JSON**: Multiple backup files in `/popup-system/backups/`
- **Expected**: 12 clean campaigns (NO Prizies)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL NOTES

1. **This is the 2nd failure** of the railway.toml fix approach
2. **Root cause is deeper** than configuration file conflicts
3. **May need Railway platform investigation** or support ticket
4. **UTM attribution code** should be reviewed for deployment impact
5. **Database persistence issue** is more complex than initially diagnosed

---

**üî• PRIORITY: Get database restored ASAP, then investigate why our fix didn't work!**

## üìû HANDOFF CHECKLIST

**For Railway Fix Agent:**
- [ ] Restore database immediately via emergency endpoint
- [ ] Verify 12 campaigns active (6 MMM + 6 MFF)  
- [ ] Check volume mounting in Railway logs
- [ ] Investigate why railway.toml fix failed
- [ ] Determine if UTM code changes caused issues
- [ ] Document actual root cause and solution
- [ ] Test database persistence after restoration

**Time Critical: Production revenue system is down until restored!** üö®
