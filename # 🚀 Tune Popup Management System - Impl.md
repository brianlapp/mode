# 🚀 Tune Popup Management System - Implementation Specification
**Production-Ready Popup Management System for Mike's Tune CPL Campaigns**

## 📋 **Executive Summary**

This specification outlines the complete development of a production-ready popup management system to replace manual Tune campaign management with an automated, scalable solution. The system will handle Mike's current 400k monthly impressions (15k/day) with architecture designed to scale to 100k+ daily impressions.

**Key Objectives:**
- **Manual Campaign Management:** Backend interface for Mike to add Tune campaigns via (click URL, impression pixel, image URL)
- **Production Popup Script:** Embeddable JavaScript for all Mode properties with Mode branding
- **Performance Analytics:** Real-time tracking, revenue attribution, and optimization insights
- **Scalable Architecture:** Handle current 15k/day volume with 10x growth potential built-in
- **Cost Efficiency:** <$15/month operating costs for exceptional ROI on $200k+ monthly revenue

## 📊 **Project Context & Requirements**

### **Current State Analysis**
- **Real Traffic Volume:** 400k impressions/month across MFF thank you pages & popup placements
- **Daily Average:** ~15k impressions/day (manageable scale for lightweight architecture)
- **Proven Demo Success:** Interactive popup demo received enthusiastic approval from Mike [[memory:4298560]]
- **Manual Entry Preference:** Mike specifically requested backend for manual campaign entry workflow
- **API Access Status:** Mike working on obtaining Tune API access ("need to dig around and find out who can give me the key")

### **Business Requirements Matrix**
| Requirement | Priority | Description | Success Criteria |
|-------------|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Manual Campaign Management | **HIGH** | Backend interface for (click URL, impression pixel, image URL) | Mike can add campaign in <5 minutes |
| Production Popup Script | **HIGH** | Embeddable JavaScript for Mode properties | <1 second load time, mobile responsive |
| Performance Tracking | **HIGH** | Real-time impression/click analytics | 100% accurate revenue attribution |
| Scalable Architecture | **MEDIUM** | Handle 15k/day → 100k+/day growth | No architecture changes needed for 10x growth |
| Revenue Optimization | **MEDIUM** | A/B testing, campaign rotation, prioritization | >15% performance improvement |

### **Technical Constraints**
- **No Streamlit for Production:** Popup script must be pure JavaScript with no external dependencies
- **Manual Entry First:** Build for Mike's current workflow, API integration is future enhancement
- **Same Repository Strategy:** Integrate with existing Mode dashboard and memory bank system
- **Budget Conscious Approach:** Maintain operating costs under $15/month for maximum ROI

## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture**

### **Backend: FastAPI + Railway Hosting**
```python
# Core API Architecture
app = FastAPI(title="Mode Popup Management API", version="1.0")

# Essential Endpoints for Mike's Workflow
GET  /api/campaigns                    # List active campaigns for admin interface
POST /api/campaigns                    # Add new campaign (Mike's manual entry)
PUT  /api/campaigns/{id}              # Update campaign settings
DELETE /api/campaigns/{id}            # Deactivate campaign
GET  /api/offers/{property_id}        # Get offers for popup rotation
POST /api/impression                   # Track impression event + analytics
POST /api/click                       # Track click event + revenue attribution
GET  /api/analytics/{property_id}     # Performance dashboard data
GET  /api/health                      # System health monitoring
```

### **Database: SQLite → PostgreSQL Migration Path**
```sql
-- Phase 1: SQLite (handles 15k/day impressions easily)
-- Phase 2: PostgreSQL (when approaching 50k+/day)

-- Core schema optimized for performance and Mike's workflow
campaigns (
    id, tune_campaign_id, aff_id, name, display_title,
    image_url, click_url, impression_pixel_url,
    active, priority, created_at, performance_score
)

impressions (
    id, campaign_id, property_code, timestamp, user_agent_hash
)

clicks (
    id, campaign_id, property_code, timestamp, revenue_estimate
)

daily_stats (
    date, campaign_id, property_code, impressions, clicks, revenue
)
```

### **Frontend: Lightweight Management Interface**
- **Tech Stack:** React.js with TailwindCSS (matches Mode branding perfectly)
- **Admin Dashboard:** Campaign CRUD interface optimized for Mike's manual entry workflow
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Real-time performance metrics and ROI tracking
- **Integration Guide:** Copy-paste code snippets for each Mode property deployment

### **Popup Script: Production JavaScript**
```javascript
// Single embeddable script - zero external dependencies
<script src="https://popup-api.railway.app/popup.js"></script>
<script>
ModePopup.init({
  property: 'mff',           // 'mff', 'mmm', 'mcad', 'mmd'
  placement: 'thankyou',     // 'thankyou', 'exit-intent', 'timed'
  frequency: 'session',      // 'session', 'daily', 'always'
  debug: false               // Enable for testing environments
});
</script>
```

## 📂 **Project Structure Integration**

### **Repository Strategy: Same Repo Integration**
**Decision Rationale:** Keep in same repo (`mode/`) for shared memory bank, Mode branding resources, and coordinated deployment
