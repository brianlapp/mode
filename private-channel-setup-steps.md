## 🎯 **INVITE MIKE WITH PERFECT CONTEXT**

### **Slack Message to Send Mike:**

```slack
Hey Mike! 🚀

I set up that private optimization channel we discussed - #mode-optimization-private

This gives us the async workflow we talked about:
• You can update dashboard data directly from Slack 
• Real-time CPL tracking without email delays
• Task assignments that I see instantly at night
• Complete privacy (just us two in this channel)

Want to test it? Try this command:
@Cursor [repo=brianlapp/mode] update MMM CPL to [current number] - testing integration

The dashboard at https://modedash.streamlit.app/ should update automatically.

This eliminates the 19-hour delay between your insights → my actions → your feedback.

Ready to be the most efficient async optimization team ever? 😎
